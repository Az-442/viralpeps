# KW Phase 1 Progress

Tracks which days of `kw-phase-1-list.md` are complete. The daily blog cron reads this to know where to resume.

**Rule:** Next day = first day in `kw-phase-1-list.md` whose articles are not all written, EXCLUDING Day 1 (owned by one-shot job `540cdc14856a`).

## Notes for future runs
- Day 1 slugs are already in `research-content.ts` — do not re-write them.
- Day 2 slugs are in `research-content.ts` + `research.ts` (guides array).
- Insert registry entries into the `guides` array (ends before `export const compoundList`), NOT the later `compoundList` string array. Both end with `];` — use `rt.find("export const compoundList")` as the boundary, or the insert lands inside `compoundList` and the build fails with *"Type '{...}' is not assignable to type 'string'"*.
- Turbopack rejects `node_modules` symlinks pointing outside the filesystem root. A git worktree at `/tmp/…` cannot build. Use a worktree **inside** the repo (`.wt/<name>`) with a relative `node_modules` symlink (`ln -s ../../node_modules node_modules`).

        body: "BPC-157 (Body Protection Compound 157) is a 15-amino-acid peptide derived from a protective protein naturally found in human gastric juice. It's not some synthetic alien molecule — it's a native signaling compound your body already knows how to use.\n\nMost compounds act like a key that fits one lock: one pathway, one target, one narrow effect. BPC-157 is different. It influences multiple biological systems involved in repair — angiogenesis, collagen signalling, nitric oxide pathways, nervous system stability, and inflammation control — without shutting anything down.\n\n[**Compare BPC-157 prices from UK suppliers →**](/compounds/bpc-157)",

        title: "The Five Core Things BPC-157 Does",

            title: "1. Drives Angiogenesis — The Right Way",
            body: "When tissue gets injured, it becomes hypoxic (low oxygen). That activates HIF-1α, which in turn activates VEGF — the body's road-building crew for new circulation. BPC-157 supercharges this HIF-1α → VEGF axis.\n\nThe critical distinction: BPC-157 produces organised, functional vascular infrastructure — not the chaotic, tumour-like vessel growth seen in pathology. More oxygen, more nutrients, better delivery, faster waste removal. It builds real roads, not demolition derbies.",

            title: "2. Turns Fibroblasts Into a Rebuilding Machine",
            body: "Once blood supply improves, structural rebuilding follows. BPC-157 amplifies TGF-β1 signalling, which activates fibroblasts and ramps up production of Type I collagen, Type III collagen, fibronectin, and elastin — the structural proteins required for organised tissue repair.\n\nThe result is regeneration with reinforcement: stronger, better-organised collagen architecture rather than disorganised scar tissue. Studies suggest BPC-157 helps tissue heal with tensile strength that approaches the uninjured original.",

            body: "BPC-157 enhances eNOS (endothelial nitric oxide synthase) activity, increasing nitric oxide production. NO relaxes vascular smooth muscle via the cGMP pathway, improving local blood flow and perfusion to injured tissues.\n\nThis is the mechanism that flips the body from breakdown into rebuild. Better circulation means better fuel delivery and better waste clearance — the essential conditions for repair to actually happen.",

Preclinical evidence indicates it supports neurite outgrowth, synaptogenesis, and protection against excitotoxic injury.\n\nThis isn't a stimulant. It's neurological rehab — helping neural tissue stabilise, recover, and rebuild after injury.",

It reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α and IL-6 while simultaneously increasing anti-inflammatory IL-10.\n\nThe goal isn't suppression. It's resolution — moving tissue from chaotic destruction into organised reconstruction.
